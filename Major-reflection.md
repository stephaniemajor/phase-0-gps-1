<p>•	What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was unclear what fetch is vs pull.</p>
<p>•	What concepts were clarified during the GPS? None really. I was too disturbed.</p>
<p>•	What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
About fetch and my pair answered.
I asked the guide if it was normal to feel so frantic and if this will hinder my chance of success</p>
<p>•	What still confuses you about git? </p>
<p>I need to get more familiar about command line and Git commands. Changing directories, branch. Still not sure about the fetch command. I am not too sure I would be able to solve the merging conflict by my own. I am still confused about mark down.</p>
<p>•	How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?</p>
<p>Awful but this was a big eye opener. </p>
<p>Working with several windows when we have to read instructions and talk and answer someone else at the same time was challenging. I need to set my windows of work in a way that will easy to navigate. </p>
<p>I will also need to read the exercise before and get familiar with it before doing the next GPS. At least, until I feel more familiar with the surrounding.</p>
